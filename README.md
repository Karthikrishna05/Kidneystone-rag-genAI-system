**VruCare** is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to provide accurate, safe, and sourced information about kidney stones. It combines semantic search with keyword matching using a custom **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** algorithm to deliver highly relevant answers from a curated medical knowledge base.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **🧠 Hybrid Search Engine:** Uses a custom-built retriever that combines **FAISS** (semantic search) and **BM25** (keyword search) to find the most relevant medical documents.
* **🏆 Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):** Implements a sophisticated re-ranking algorithm to fuse results from both search methods, ensuring high accuracy for both broad concepts and specific medical terms (e.g., "Tamsulosin").
* **💬 Context-Aware Conversations:** Remembers chat history and intelligently reformulates follow-up questions (e.g., understanding "What are the side effects?" refers to the previous topic).
* **⚡ Streaming Responses:** Provides a real-time, typewriter-style experience for low-latency interaction.
* **🛡️ Safety First:** Engineered with strict system prompts to refuse medical diagnosis or treatment advice, directing users to professionals.
* **🆓 Cost-Effective:** Powered by **OpenRouter's free tier** (Gemini 2.0 Flash / Llama 3), making it free to run while maintaining high performance.

🏃‍♂️ How to Run
Step 1: Build the Knowledge Base ("The Brain")
Before running the app, you must ingest your PDF documents. Place your PDFs in the data/ folder and run:
```
Bash

python src/vectorizer.py
```
This will create the vectorstore/ folder containing your index.

Step 2: Launch the Chatbot
```
Bash

streamlit run src/app.py
```
The app will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501.
